This project is a logo maker that creates SVG logos using JavaScript and Node.js. The user will be prompted to choose a shape (triangle, square, or circle), enter a color, enter a color for the text, and enter three letters to be displayed in the logo. The application will then create an SVG file with the chosen shape and text.
